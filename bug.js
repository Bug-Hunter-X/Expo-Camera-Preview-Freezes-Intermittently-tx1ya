This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific configurations, such as enabling the flash or setting a custom aspect ratio.  It manifests as an unexpected behavior where the camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive after a certain amount of time or actions. The camera might still be technically capturing images, but the preview will be stuck, showing a frozen frame.
