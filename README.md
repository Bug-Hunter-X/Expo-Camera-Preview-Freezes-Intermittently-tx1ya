# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where the preview can freeze intermittently under certain conditions. The issue seems related to flash usage and custom aspect ratios, although it's not consistently reproducible.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes, displaying a static image.  Image capture may still function, but the preview will not update.  This makes the user experience poor.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Experiment with enabling the flash and different aspect ratios.
4. Observe if the preview freezes after some time or interaction.

## Potential Causes

* Resource management issues within the Expo Camera API.
* Conflicts with other components or libraries.
* Issues handling specific camera hardware capabilities.

## Solution (In bugSolution.js)

The solution involved adding a timeout to manually trigger a preview reset after a certain duration of inactivity.  This is not ideal but provides a workaround.  A true fix likely requires deeper investigation and resolution from the Expo team.
